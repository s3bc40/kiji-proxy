# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains all CI/CD workflows for the Kiji Privacy Proxy project.

## Workflow Overview

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose | Artifacts |
|----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **changesets.yml** | Push to `main` | Creates Version PRs | None |
| **release.yml** | Release PR merged, Tag `v*`, Manual | Tags, builds all platforms, creates single release | DMG, tar.gz, zip + checksums (90 days) |
| **lint-and-test.yml** | Push/PR to `main`/`develop` | Linting and tests | None |
| **semantic-pr.yml** | PR opened/edited | Enforces Conventional Commits in PR titles | None |
| **cleanup-artifacts.yml** | Daily (2 AM UTC), Manual | Cleans old artifacts | None |
| **sign-model.yml** | Manual only | Signs ML models | Signed models (30 days) |

## Main Workflows

### 1. Changesets Workflow (`changesets.yml`)

**Purpose:** Manages version bumping and changelog generation.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch

**What it does:**
1. Detects pending changesets in `.changeset/` directory
2. Runs `changeset version` to bump versions in `src/frontend/package.json` and root `package.json`
3. Syncs `.vscode/launch.json` dev version
4. Updates `CHANGELOG.md`
5. Creates/updates a "Version PR" (branch: `changeset-release/main`, label: `release`)

**Requires:** **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → "Allow
GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** must be enabled. The
workflow uses the auto-generated `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no PAT or GitHub App needed).

CI does **not** run on the Version PR itself — `pull_request` workflows opened
by `GITHUB_TOKEN` don't trigger downstream workflow runs. This is acceptable
for this PR because its diff is purely mechanical (`package.json` bumps and
`.changeset/*.md` deletions).

---

### 2. Release Workflow (`release.yml`)

**Purpose:** Tags the release, builds all platforms in parallel, and creates a single GitHub release with all assets.

**Triggers:**
- Release PR (label: `release`) merged to `main` — automatic end-to-end path
- Tag starting with `v*` pushed manually
- Manual via Actions UI (`workflow_dispatch`)

**On the PR-merge path**, the `create-release` job creates and pushes the
`v{version}` tag itself (using `GITHUB_TOKEN`) right before publishing the
GitHub release. There is no separate auto-tag workflow.

**Jobs:**

| Job | Runner | What it does | Permissions |
|-----|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **build-dmg** | `macos-latest` | Builds signed macOS DMG | `contents: read` |
| **build-linux** | `ubuntu-latest` | Builds Linux binary archive | `contents: read` |
| **build-chrome** | `ubuntu-latest` | Packages Chrome extension | `contents: read` |
| **create-release** | `ubuntu-latest` | Downloads all artifacts, creates single release | `contents: write` |

The three build jobs run in parallel. The `create-release` job waits for all builds to complete, then creates one atomic GitHub release with all assets and the `--latest` flag. This eliminates the race condition that previously occurred when separate workflows competed to create/publish releases.

**Environment:** `DMG Build Environment` (for `build-dmg` job only)

**Required secrets (in the environment):**
- `CSC_LINK` - Base64-encoded `.p12` certificate
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` - Password for the `.p12` certificate

**Notarization secrets (currently unused, see TODOs below):**
- `APPLE_ID`
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

**Caching:** LFS objects, Go modules, Rust/Cargo, tokenizers library, ONNX Runtime.

---

### 3. Lint and Test Workflow (`lint-and-test.yml`)

**Purpose:** Code quality checks and tests.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop`
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop`

**Jobs:**

| Job | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| **Python Lint** | Runs `ruff` linter and formatter on `model/src/` and `model/dataset/` |
| **Go Lint** | Runs `golangci-lint` |
| **Go Tests** | Runs `make test-go` (depends on Go Lint passing) |
| **Frontend Lint & Type Check** | Runs ESLint and TypeScript type checking on `src/frontend/` |

---

### 4. Cleanup Artifacts Workflow (`cleanup-artifacts.yml`)

**Purpose:** Manages storage by cleaning old artifacts.

**Triggers:**
- Daily at 2 AM UTC (automatic)
- Manual via Actions UI (with dry-run option)

**What it does:**
1. Deletes artifacts older than 7 days
2. Deletes artifacts from failed/cancelled runs

**Manual options:**
- Dry run mode (default: true) - shows what would be deleted without deleting

---

### 5. Sign Model Workflow (`sign-model.yml`)

**Purpose:** Cryptographically signs ML models.

**Triggers:**
- Manual only (via Actions UI)

**Options:**
- **OIDC signing** (default): Uses GitHub's OIDC tokens
- **Private key signing**: Uses `SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` repository secret

**What it does:**
1. Signs model files with cryptographic signature
2. Verifies the signature
3. Uploads signed artifacts (30 day retention)

---

### 6. Semantic PR Title Workflow (`semantic-pr.yml`)

**Purpose:** Enforces Conventional Commits format in PR titles.

**Triggers:**
- Pull request opened, edited, or synchronized

**What it does:**
1. Validates the PR title matches `type(optional scope): description`
2. On failure, posts a sticky comment with the error and a formatting guide
3. On success, removes the comment if one was previously posted

**Allowed types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`

**Tip:** To make this a hard gate, add it as a required status check in **Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules**.

## TODOs

### Notarization (macOS DMG)

Notarization is currently **disabled**. The DMG is code-signed but not notarized by Apple. Users may see Gatekeeper warnings when opening the app.

**To enable notarization:**

1. Obtain a **Developer ID Application** certificate from the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list) (under "Software" > "Developer ID Application"). The current certificate is an "Apple Development" certificate, which Apple's notarization service rejects.

2. Export the certificate as a `.p12` file from Keychain Access, base64-encode it (`base64 -i certificate.p12 | pbcopy`), and update the `CSC_LINK` secret in the `DMG Build Environment` GitHub environment.

3. Update `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` with the `.p12` export password.

4. Add `"afterSign": "../../src/scripts/notarize.js"` to the `build` config in `src/frontend/package.json` (see the `_note` field at the top of that file).

5. In `src/scripts/build_dmg.sh`, remove the `unset APPLE_ID` / `unset APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` / `unset APPLE_TEAM_ID` lines that currently suppress notarization.

6. In `.github/workflows/release.yml`, uncomment the `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` checks in the `build-dmg` job's "Verify signing secrets" step.

## Maintenance

### Adding a New Workflow

1. Create `.github/workflows/your-workflow.yml`
2. Document it in this README
3. Test with `workflow_dispatch` first
4. Update the table at the top

### Common Issues

**Workflow not triggering:**
- Check trigger conditions (`if:` clauses)
- Verify branch/path filters
- Check repository permissions

**DMG signing secrets not available:**
- Ensure the job has `environment: "DMG Build Environment"`
- Verify secrets are stored in the GitHub environment (not repository secrets)
- Environment names are case-sensitive

**Build failures:**
- Check LFS files are downloaded (not pointer files)
- Verify all dependencies installed
- Review step-by-step logs
